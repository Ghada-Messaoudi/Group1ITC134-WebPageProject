		  <a href="https://cygwin.com/" target="_blank">cygwin.com</a>
		  <p>The name Cygwin was created from a combination of Cygnus and Windows.
			Cygwin is an open source collection of tools that allows Unix or Linux  applications to be compiled and run on a Windows operating system from within a Linux-like interface. This capability helps developers to migrate applications
			 from Unix or Linux to Windows-based systems, and makes it easier to support their applications running on the Windows platform. Cygwin includes a dynamic link library (DLL) and a collection of tools. The DLL serves as a Linux emulator, 
			 and the tool set provides the Linux-like development environment.
